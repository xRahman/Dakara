• Duplicate layer 2 times
• Invert colors
• Apply "Minimum" fileter with "Radius 2.0", "Preserve: Roundness"
• Set Blending mode to "Difference"
• Merge with base image
• Do not remove artifacts (they actually cancel with those from next step)
• Blend with base image using "Hard Mix" mode with opacity 100% and Fill 75%
• Now remove any remaining artifacts using Healing Brush
• Now we need to aplly 'Color to Alpha' which doesn't exist in Photoshop.
  So instead we do this:
    • Right click the layer you want to add transparency to, pick the "Blending
      Options..." (If unable to pick 'Blending options' ensure that the layer is
      unlocked)
    • Locate the scale under the "This layer:" that is under the "Blend if" box.
    • Pres and hold 'Alt' and drag the left half of right 'knob' under
      "This Layer" slider all the way to the left.
